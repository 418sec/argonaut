6.0-RC2 contains a critical fix to the optional decoder and lots of performance improvements.

 * Parser performance improvements. See #47.

 * Printer performance improvements. See #48.

 * Fix option decoder. See #49 and markhibberd/argonaut.io#1.

   This includes a significant enhancement to DecodeJson to explicitly
   allow error handling on previously failed cursor navigation. This
   change should be source compatible with RC1 though.
