6.0-M3 was primarily to keep up with Scalaz 7.0.0-M9.

  * Added JsonArray lens thanks to @halcat0x15a

  * Fixed Cursor#rightN which could loop indefinitely

  * ACursor#focus new returns an option. Focus is `Some`
    only when `succeeded` is `true`. ACursor#focusFailed
    returns `Some` only when `succeeded is `false`.
