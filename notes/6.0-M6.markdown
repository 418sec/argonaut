6.0-M6 contains some major changes.

 * Major rework of `JsonObject` to elliminate pretty printing bottleneck, #43.

 * Introduced `CodecJson` to allow for `EncodeJson` and `DecodeJson` to
   be specified together. `CodecJson` includes a `laws` attribute to
   assist with testing codecs, #18, #41, #45.

 * Introduced `codec*` conveniences up to 22 for building `CodecJson`
   type class instances.

 * Introduced `casecodec*` conveniences up to 22 for building `CodecJson`
   type class instances for case classes. Note this relies on
   `_.unapply andThen (_.get)`.

 * Fixed major regression in implicit search for EncodeJson/DecodeJson
   caused by ambiguous Tuple1 instances. #44.
