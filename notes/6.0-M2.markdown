6.0-M2 was primarily work on printing performance but a number
of other small changes were made:

  * Significant performance improvements to pretty printing code.

  * Long and Int decoders re-instated support for decoding from both
    numbers and strings.

  * ParserWrap and Parser `Nel` methods were renamed to `Message`.
    This reflects the fact that the error is a single string and no
    longer an empty list.

  * Added Encode/Decode codecs for `Vector`.

  * Added specialised traversal operations on `HCursor`.

  * Added tail-recursive co-routine `loop` operation to `DecodeResult`.
